# Semester 5 Project Backend

This repository contains the backend server for my Semester 5 project, which provides RESTful APIs for an Android app developed in Java. The server is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Project Overview

This project serves as the backend for a Java-based Android application. It handles various tasks such as user authentication, data management, and communication with the MongoDB database.

### Features

- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for CRUD operations.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Database**: Integrated with MongoDB for data persistence.
- **Express.js**: Lightweight and fast web framework for Node.js.
- **Environment Variables**: Configured using `.env` files for sensitive information.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the REST API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure authentication.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB, simplifying database operations.
